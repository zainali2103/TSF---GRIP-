# Student Score Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict a student's percentage score based on the number of hours they study per day using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv).

## Problem Statement
Predict the percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of study hours. Specifically, determine the score for a student who studies **9.25 hours/day**.

---


## Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
- **Hours**: Number of hours a student studies per day.
- **Scores**: Percentage of marks obtained.

The dataset can be directly loaded from this URL:
